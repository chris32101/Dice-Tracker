## Overview    
There are lots of tools/websites that allow users to see particular stats of their favorite athletes. Allowing users to track their own statistics in their own hobbies (like snappa) can allow the same feeling as their favorite athlete; aiming to compare themselves to the pinnacle of the sport. Of course, a simple stat tracker could be found on any website but nothing can dynamically include different rules that vary from college to college, compare your stats for any dice game, against any player around the world! This project aims to be an open-source dice-oriented version of DigitalScout, Teamsnap, and even Wooterâ€™s own personal football stat tracking tool.

<b>Problem Statement</b>
<br>
Throughout college campuses around the globe, â€œDieâ€œ is a popular game played by close friends and family that stimulates fast reflexes and fine motor skills. The problem found between both casual and competitive Die players is there is no real application that can guide their games while feasibly tracking and documenting their performance as they play games. There also does not exist an application that creates a fantasy league based on Die to compete with your friends as well. To best serve this growing problem, we will be developing a web application that will be used for all things Die such as a guide on how to play, ease of use user-inputted statistic-tracking, personalized statistics for each user, a league creation so that your friends can join a structured competition and a fantasy Die portion as well.

<b>Proposed Solution</b>
<br>
Our new and interactive web application will contain user-friendly features that would allow the users to easily track and publicly or privately display their information to the world or friends and family. The application will also contain a practical user-inputted statistic tracking system to help keep track of statistics, a personalized user statistic page that holds tables and charts mapping the statistics of a user, and a league creation section where users can sign up to play with their friends in a structured competition.

3. Confirm the installation of **npm** by running `npm -v` in a terminal of your choice (ie: command prompt)
4. You should *theoretically* be on the latest version of `npm`, but you could run the following line `npm install -g npm` (optional)
5. `cd` to `/frontend/`
6. Run `npm install` to install all packages found in `package.json`.
7. Finally, run `npm run dev`
