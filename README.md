## Vision Statement
<b>Problem Statement</b>
<br>
Throughout college campuses around the globe, â€œDieâ€œ is a popular game played by close friends and family that stimulates fast reflexes and fine motor skills. The problem found between both casual and competitive Die players is there is no real application that can guide their games while feasibly tracking and documenting their performance as they play games. There also does not exist an application that creates a fantasy league based on Die to compete with your friends as well. To best serve this growing problem, we will be developing a web application that will be used for all things Die such as a guide on how to play, ease of use user-inputted statistic-tracking, personalized statistics for each user, a league creation so that your friends can join a structured competition and a fantasy Die portion as well.

<b>Proposed Solution</b>
<br>
Our new and interactive web application will contain user-friendly features that would allow the users to easily track and publicly or privately display their information to the world or friends and family. The application will also contain a practical user-inputted statistic tracking system to help keep track of statistics, a personalized user statistic page that holds tables and charts mapping the statistics of a user, and a league creation section where users can sign up to play with their friends in a structured competition.
